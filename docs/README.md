# JavaScript_Challenge1
This is the first challenge for Javascript in the UCF bootcamp.

We are making a random password generator using various javascript functions.

It has to have certain parameters such as how many characters the password can be, what is acceptable as a password versus what is not acceptable, i.e. acceptance criteria, what the prompting for the passwords say and various functions like that.

Ultimately, this challenge will be periodically pushed from VS Code to Github with different commits and will be done in very small sprint sized increments.
